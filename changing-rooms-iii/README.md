##### `Step 1.`\|`SPCRK`|:small_blue_diamond:

Lets put the ray in the desert room and have it fade out.  So open rm_desert and drag a obj_teleporter_ray into the room in the proper position in the teleporter.
			<h3>rm_desert</h3>

##### `Step 2.`\|`FHIU`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: 

Open the player create event and lets make the image_alpha equal to 0 when the state is TELEPORTER and 1 when the player state is TELEPORTERLEAVE.

##### `Step 3.`\|`SPCRK`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Go to the ray step event and fade in for TELEPORTER and out for TELEPORTERLEAVE states.  Alter it to match:

##### `Step 4.`\|`SPCRK`|:small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="play button icon"> Play Button and run towards the teleporter. Now it should work pretty much the way I want it to.

##### `Step 5.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond:

Now we want to also go back to the previous room if we re-enter the teleporter in the sand level.  So in the player alarm0 event we need to check to see which room we are in, then go to the opposite room. obj_player: Alarm0 Event

##### `Step 6.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="play button icon"> Play Button and run towards the teleporter. Now go back to the the castle room.  Now the only problem is that the ray does not turn back on when returning to the castle.

##### `Step 7.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Go to the castle room and add obj_teleporter_ray in the teleporter.

##### `Step 8.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Now we want it to be off when the game is started at the beginning.  So we need to open the ray's step event and add a check for INGAME state and then set the alpha off.

##### `Step 9.`\|`SPCRK`| :small_orange_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond: :small_blue_diamond:

Also don't forget that we spawned the ray previously.  Since we changed our design when we added the room we need to comment out or delete the instance_create_layer() call so we don't create multiple unecessary rays!

##### `Step 10.`\|`SPCRK`| :large_blue_diamond:

Run the game by pressing the <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://marcaubanel.com/gamemaker/GMS2-Images/Shared/Icon_RunProject.png" alt="play button icon"> Play Button and run towards the teleporter. Now go back to the the castle room. Now it should be working as we planned.  This is enough, now lets look at adding some text boxes.
