##### `Step 1.`\|`TDAAG`|:small_blue_diamond:

You will have a new folder called **GMS2-Action-Adventure-Game**.  If you open it you will find that I have a project that is ready to go with some artwork and scripts to help get you started faster.

You have a **README.txt** file that you can add your name to.  As you are completing the walk through, you can add comments about the walk through.
